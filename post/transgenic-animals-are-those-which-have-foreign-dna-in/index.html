        <p>Foreign dna is introduced into the animal, using recombinant dna technology and then transmitted through the germ line so that every cell, including germ cells of the animal, contain the same modified genetic material. Transgenic refers to an organism or cell whose genome has been altered by the introduction of one or more foreign dna sequences from another species by artificial means.</p>

        <h3>A Transgenic Animal Is One That Carries A Foreign Gene That Has Been Deliberately Inserted Into Its Genome.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Transgenic organism is one that has become transformed following the introduction of novel genes into its genome. •usually genes of interest are transferred, which are required to expressed. This gene gives an extra character to that animal.</p>
        <h3>Foreign Dna And Rna In Some Of Its Cells.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Transgenic animals are the ones whose dna has been manipulated in such a way that they can possess and express an extra foreign gene. Transgenic animals have been widely used in the field of biotechnology. Textbook solutions 10946 important solutions 7.</p>
        <h3>Theoretically, All Living Beings Can Be Genetically Manipulated.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Transgenic animals are animals (most commonly mice) that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome. The term transgenic animal refers to an animal in which there has been a deliberate modification of the genome. This fertilized egg divides mitotically to form the whole organism so that all the cells of the organism will carry.</p>
        <h3>Scientists Do This, Creating A Transgenic Organism, To Study The Function Of The Introduced Gene And To Identify Genetic Elements That Determine Which Tissue And At What Stage Of An Organism&#039;s Development A Gene Is Normally Turned On.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Foreign rna in all its cells. When there were not technologies like biotechnology or genetic engineering, the farmers would breed their animals selectively for the increased production of. Correct option is b) transgenic animals are animals that have had a foreign gene deliberately inserted into their genome.</p>
        <h3>Foreign Dna In All Their Cells.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Transgenesis is the phenomenon in which a f oreign gene with desired characteristics is introduced into the genome of the target animal. A foreign gene is inserted into the genome of the animal to alter its dna. Foreign dna and rna in all its cells.</p>
