        <h3>An Example Of An Animal Adaptation Is Thick Coats To Keep Them Shielded From The Cold And Wind.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>During the summer, brown bears behavior is to eat about anything they can find. Some of the most prominent animal adaptations that tundra animals sport include the presence of thick fur and rich deposits of fat to help them survive the freezing cold, small ears to minimize heat loss, small bodies to ensure minimal exposure to frigid air, and broad feet to make it easier for them to walk on snow. This is why plants as well animals in the arctic tundra biome endure its testing conditions.</p>
        <h3>It Is Also Physical Adaptations.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Animals need shelter and insulation in the tundra. One ecological issue includes very little drainage of water because of the permafrost, which is a layer of. Tundra animals adaptations to environment.</p>
        <h3>Animals Have Many Adaptations To Survive In This Harsh Environment.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The conservation institute notes that there are a few common elements that tie many tundra animals together, such as heat retention. The weather conditions at tundra are so harsh that only a handful of plants and animals can even survive there. Lemmings, arctic hares and arctic ground squirrels are a few animals that have adapted to the cold.</p>
        <h3>The Arctic Penguin Has Blubber That Insulates And Traps Heat;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Animals are adapted to handle long,. Animals and humans living in the region have adapted to the conditions, such as they live comfortably during tundra biomes periods. Mosquitoes (aedes nigripes), for example, have a chemical compound that acts as antifreeze, lowering the freezing temperature in their bodily fluids.</p>
