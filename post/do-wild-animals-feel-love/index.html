        <h3>If An Animal Can Feel Pain, Then I Believe It Is.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Currently, the evidence is strongly supportive that all vertebrate animals have feelings that should include pleasure. They are loving, compassionate and a friend to all people. And like equines, have developed a capacity.</p>
        <h3>Dolphins Routinely Show Love For Species Not Their Own.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If animals are attracted to you, it is an honor. Some of the animals that mate for life include gray wolves, bald eagles, sandhill cranes, penguins, swans, vultures. All the animals that i come into contact with seem to like me (even bugs are drawn to me, much to my displeasure).</p>
        <h3>Since They&#039;re Herd Animals, Llamas And Alpacas Tend To Enjoy Companionship, Van Every Says.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>People love their cats and dogs, so they naturally want to be loved back. In fact, all mammals enjoy being caressed, humans included. The goat, however, was enraptured.</p>
        <h3>I&#039;ve Always Loved Animals And I&#039;ve Been Noticing For Quite Some Time That They Really, Really Like Certain People.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Wildlife comes in all shapes, sizes, and colours. They can feel great love and warmth for people they are friends with, and also express it in different ways by snuggling, patting or bringing small gifts like sticks, grass or branches for their human friends. The dog had a 48 percent increase in oxytocin, meaning it viewed the goat as a friend.</p>
        <h3>When You’re Out In Nature, You Will Marvel At.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Several dolphins have practiced random acts of kindness by rescuing swimmers from hammerhead sharks. After all, fear is a function of survival. The idea that animals can feel pain has also been proven through clinical tests, like teaching animals to fear their food supply through electric shocks, as psychologist b.f.</p>
