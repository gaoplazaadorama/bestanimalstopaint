        <h3>Bactrian Camels Found In The Gobi And Takla Makan Deserts Have Thick And Coarse, Hairy Coats To Keep Them Warm During The Cold Winters, And They Shed These Thick Coats As Summer Sets In.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Desert animals like camels have adapted over thousands of years for life in an environment where there is little water available for long periods of time. The winters are quite cold, temperatures sometimes below freezing point, while heat during summer is intense and scorching. Adaptations help desert animals to acquire and retain water, and to regulate body temperatures, which helps them to survive in the harsh conditions of the desert.</p>
        <h3>Animals Of Desert Ecosystem Are Much More Affected By Extremes Of Temperature Than Desert Plants Because The Biological Processes Of Animal Tissue Function Properly Within A Relatively Narrow.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The above listed are some examples of hot desert plants and cold desert plant adaptations that are employed by plants that live in the desert to survive and reproduce. Bactrian camels also have thick eyebrows, eye lashes and nostril hair. Plant and animal bodies are made up of a number of complex biological processes which take place within a.</p>
        <h3>Physical Adaptations Are Special Body Parts, Such As Shapes, Skin, And Color, That Help The Organisms To Survive In Their Natural Habitat.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Drinking less water is a behavioral adaptation, but the behavioral change spurred physiological adaptations over the generations. Animals such as the kit fox have special adaptations for living in the desert. Large, fleshy stems to store water.</p>
        <h3>The Key To The Survival In</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Have light coloured fur to reflect sunlight and keep their bodies cools. It has a longer, darker winter coat, short legs and seldom measures more than 2.1 m from the ground to the top of the humps. Large ears for dissipating body heat;</p>
        <h3>Like Animals In Any Other Desert, The Animals In The Cold Desert Need Specific Adaptations To Survive In The Harsh Conditions Of The Cold Deserts Like Antarctic And Gobi.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>But mammals are more likely to. The soils of the sahara desert are low in organic matter and are often biologically inactive. Animals living in cold or temperate deserts have thick exoskeletons to protect them from the cold dry winds.</p>
