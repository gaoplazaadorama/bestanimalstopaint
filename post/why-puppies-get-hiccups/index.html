        <h3>Enter The Hiccups, Which Occur When Your Pup’s Diaphragm Becomes Irritated, Possibly From Eating Or Drinking Too Fast.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These can be positive stimuli such as toys and playing or something more negative, such as nervous feelings around other animals. Exhaling pushes it up to help clear the air out of the lungs. Often, they will get an episode of the hiccups because they have eaten or drunk too quickly (causing them to gulp down air at the same time), or because they have gotten too full.</p>
        <h3>Puppies Typically Get Hiccups As A Result Of Eating Their Food Or Drinking Their Water Too Quickly.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Puppy hiccups are either adorable or annoying. And just like human babies, puppies also experience hiccups much more frequently than adult dogs. Intense exercise and running around 4.</p>
        <h3>It Could Also Happen When He Eats Or Drinks Too Fast.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dogs that eat and drink too quickly also tend to be more. Why do puppies get hiccups frequently? Hiccups in puppies, and in adult dogs, are caused by rapid contractions of the diaphragm, the thin muscle that separates a dog’s chest cavity from their abdomen.</p>
        <h3>If You Suspect Your Dog Is Hiccuping Because It&#039;s Not Used To The Current Dog Food, Try A Different Brand To See If It Alleviates.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Why do puppies get hiccups? The diaphragm’s main job is to help dogs inhale and exhale. When the diaphragm starts functioning abnormally, enter the hiccups!</p>
        <h3>It May Be Because Their Stomach Is Empty Or There Is Excess Gas Built Up Within Their Gut.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When your puppy breathes in, their diaphragm contracts and moves downward, giving their lungs room to expand. Hiccups occur when the nerve endings connected to the diaphragm get irritated. Another possibility is that puppies’ muscles are weaker, and their bodies are not fully matured, making them more prone to muscle contractions.</p>
