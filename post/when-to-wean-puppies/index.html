        <h3>Different Breeders Have Their Own Timetable For Weaning, But This Generally Commences When The Puppies Are About 3 Weeks Old.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Weaning puppies usually starts at around three to four weeks into their lives. Weaning should always be a gradual process and puppies should never be abruptly taken away from the mother. When the puppies begin eating the solid food, start weaning the mother off of puppy food back onto adult food.</p>
        <h3>Claims Amber Johnson, An Animal Behaviorist.</h3>

        <h3>However, If The Litter Is Unusually Large Then Weaning Can Begin A Little Earlier In Order To Prevent The Bitch From Becoming Overly Fatigued.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Sometimes, puppies are weaned off their mother&#039;s care and milk after a month, while others don&#039;t until 6 weeks. Puppies are weaned when they are independent of mom and are not nursing at all. Do not rush weaning in your puppies, and give the youngsters sufficient time to adapt to eating soft foods before totally stopping with the.</p>
