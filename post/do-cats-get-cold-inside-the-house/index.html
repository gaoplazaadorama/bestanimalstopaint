    <br/>
    <p>Other things that you can do to help keep kitty warm include: If you see any of the above in your cat, it’s time to bring them to the vet immediately. However, some cats may experience complications, such as a secondary bacterial infection or pneumonia.</p>
        <h3>Visitors To The House May Also Bring The Virus In On Their Hands If They Have A Cat Who Has A Cold.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A cat in danger of hypothermia may become sluggish, with dilated pupils or shallow breathing. Make sure your cat is microchipped, and the details are up to date. Like humans who have arthritis, we know very well what the cold does to us—so keep in mind that it affects senior cats the same way.</p>
        <h3>Your Cat Won’t Be Too Cold, Provided That Your Home’s Ambient Temperature Stays Above 70 Degrees Fahrenheit.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If windows are open in the house (protected by mesh to stop the cat getting out) it is conceivable that air droplets can come into the house if a wandering cat outside had a cold. Consider a heated cat bed if your cat is constantly cold. Yes, they can survive the cold weather but it’s best to either keep them inside or provide a shelter that keeps them warm outside you don’t want your little furball to catch hypothermia or any other illnesses due to the cold weather</p>
        <h3>Determining What Temperature Is Too Cold For Cats Depends On The Age, Breed, Fur, Health, And Body Mass.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>This is a popular sleep position for cats, so it definitely doesn’t always mean your little one is feeling cold, but if they’re tightly curled up with their tail over their nose and all their paws tucked into their body, it’s a clue that. It happens when they spend too much time in cold temperatures, or when cats with poor health or circulation are exposed to cold. If cats remain in a place with a temperature below 32 degrees fahrenheit, they may suffer from hypothermia and possibly frostbite.</p>
        <h3>A Cold Cat Might Seek Out Warmer Spaces More Frequently Than Usual.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For example, they may go outdoors unexpectedly on a cold day or get trapped in a cold region of your home, such as the basement, attic, or an uninsulated crawlspace. Put your feline friend in her pet carrier and make sure she is calm. Are cats affected by the cold in the house?</p>
