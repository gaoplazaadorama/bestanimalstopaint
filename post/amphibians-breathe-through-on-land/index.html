        <h3>The Species In This Group Include Frogs, Toads, Salamanders, And Newts.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The nostrils are then closed, and the floor of the mouth is elevated. Apart from these, the frogs can breathe through their mouth. Due to the evolution that occurs with every amphibian during metamorphosis, their lungs change as well.</p>
        <h3>If Their Skin Is Not Kept Moist Then They Will Die.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>These creatures have the ability to breathe through their skin, apart from their lung to survive on land. They secrete mucous to keep the skin moist if they get dry, they cannot breathe and will die. Amphibians lay eggs in water, not on land, and their eggs are soft, with no hard shell.</p>
        <h3>Traditionally, The Class Amphibia Includes All Tetrapod Vertebrates That Are Not.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Frogs, toads, and salamanders are all amphibians. Amphibians on land primarily breathe through their lungs. If you want to find out more about how amphibians breathe, please read on.</p>
        <h3>The Way Amphibians Breathe Is Directly Related To The Environment In Which They Live Because A Lot Of It Depends On Whether They Are In Water Or On Land.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος (amphíbios), which means &#039;both kinds of life&#039;, ἀμφί meaning &#039;of both kinds&#039; and βιος meaning &#039;life&#039;. Amphibians live in both water and on land. Characteristics of skin respiration at this point, it’s already very clear to us that most of the respiration of amphibians is carried out by their epidermal structures.</p>
        <h3>The Way To Breathe Through The Gills Is As Follows:</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Amphibians go through four distinct stages during their life cycle: They undergo a number of changes as they grow older,. This also makes them highly vulnerable to pollution.</p>
