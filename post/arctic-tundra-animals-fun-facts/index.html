        <h3>The Arctic Tundra Might Be Cold And Harsh, But It Still Spans About 20% Of The Earth’s Surface, Which Is Pretty Remarkable.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Arctic animals list with pictures &amp; facts: The animal populations of the tundra biome can fluctuate greatly over the course of a year. Snow covers the ground for nine months of the year when plants cannot grow.</p>
        <h3>The Alpine Tundra Is Fairly Different From The Arctic Tundra As The Alpine Tundra Biome Is Located Atop Mountains At Very High Altitudes Where Temperatures Drop Dramatically.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The arctic tundra is one of the world’s youngest biomes, forming ten thousand years ago from a retreating continental glacier. The species of mammals found in the antarctic tundra biome are quite similar to those found in the arctic tundra region. The word tunturia means a treeless plain.</p>
        <h3>The Tundra Is A Biome Where Low Temperatures And Shorter Days, Mean.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Animals found in the tundra include the arctic hare, arctic fox, musk ox, yak, pika, antarctic penguin, polar bear, the snowy owl, the himalayan tahr, and the caribou. In fact it is the driest place on earth! Usually, all the arctic wolves are fast runners and and the high speed allows this white wolf to catch prey easily for its food supply.</p>
        <h3>There Are Some Places Where Humans Have Reached Into The Arctic Tundra.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Most tundra is around the arctic circle, but there is also tundra near antarctica and on high mountains. The tundra biome includes antarctica despite the fact that it is not situated inside the arctic circle. The region is cold, dry, and windy.</p>
        <h3>There Are Mostly Arctic Hares, Polar Bears, Voles, And Even Birds Like Ravens.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Notable animals in the arctic tundra include reindeer (caribou), musk ox, arctic hare, arctic fox, snowy owl, lemmings, and even polar bears near the ocean. How fast can a tundra wolf run? When the snow melts, the tough grasses, mosses, and small shrubs have a short, quick growing season.</p>
