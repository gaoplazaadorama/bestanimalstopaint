    <p>Asian leopard cat is a small wild animal that weights only about 4.5 pounds and which inhabits the forests of south asia. The bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted egyptian mau, with the asian leopard cat (prionailurus bengalensis). But no need to worry.</p>
        <h3>The Bengal Cat Is A Domestic Breed Of Cat Created By Crossing Domestic Cats With The Asian Leopard Cat (A Small Wild Cat).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A distinctive feature of the bengal cat is considered to be its chic appearance. However, some bengal cats can continue to grow for an additional year, but that is very rare. The bengal looks like a wild cat and it can weigh up to 7kg.</p>
