        <p>No one knows exactly why, but one theory is that a crying infant sounds like a baby animal or kitten in distress, which may be why your cat is. While this may be due to the fact that cat mewling and baby mewling are similar by chance, i think there may be a biological reason behind it.</p>

        <h3>The Sound Of A Cat&#039;s Cry Might Be Acute, Often Reminding Us Of The Sounds Human Newborns Make.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Cats can be vocal for a variety of reasons. As mentioned previously, typically, cat crying is normal and merely a sign of boredom. Your kitty is in its stage of developing its personality, and is looking for other cats to model its behavior.</p>
        <h3>Like Babies, The Sound Can Have Different Meanings Depending On Their Need.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Keep your kitten’s litter box clean and available to it, which may also stop your kitten from crying. I have 8 orphaned kittens at the moment, six that are 8 weeks old and two that are 3 weeks old. Cats and kittens are very sensitive about cleanliness, especially of their litter boxes.</p>
        <h3>Since Many Types Of Crying Are Normal For Our Cats, The Focus Of This Article Is The Kitty That Suddenly Starts To Yowl.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Make sure the litter box is small enough so that your kitten can easily get in and out of it. “every time they’re silent, they get a reward. Changes in the home, new people, new animals or other causes could stress your cat out.</p>
        <h3>They&#039;re Urinating And Defecating Normally, Etc.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>While this may be due to the fact that cat mewling and baby mewling are similar by chance, i think there may be a biological reason behind it. I&#039;m feeding them both constantly, they&#039;re both free of parasites and by all accounts very healthy. When she stops crying, the owner can wait about a minute and then go to the cat and give it food, playtime or affection.</p>
        <h3>Perhaps He Took A Long Nap Behind The Refrigerator And Is Now Unable To Leave.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The owner can also try to give the cat these things on a regular, scheduled basis regardless so that the cat won&#039;t feel compelled to cry for attention. I can&#039;t figure out what&#039;s wrong with him. Your cat wants cat food.</p>
