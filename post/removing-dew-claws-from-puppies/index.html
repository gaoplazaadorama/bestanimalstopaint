        <h3>In Others, It’s Done To Prevent Possible Injuries, Such As Being Damaged While A Hunting Dog Works Through Brambles.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Granted, removal of dew claws in puppies is a lot less complex than it is in adult dogs, but it’s still going to require surgery done under anesthesia. Breeders typically remove the dewclaw on puppies when they’re very young, while dog owners might do so much later in life. There are always specific reasons why this act is done, with a lot of conversation happening between vets, breeders, and owners before the choices are made.</p>
        <h3>Dewclaw Removal Is A Surgical Procedure Performed Under General Anesthesia.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Dewclaws are removed by both breeders and owners. If dewclaw removal is to take place, this procedure should be done by the time the puppy is 3 days old. Donna shares her reasoning behind why she does not remove the dew claws on any of her dogs and her recommendations about dew claws in general.</p>
        <h3>In Some Breeds, The Removal Is Thought To Improve Appearance For The Show Ring.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Often, dewclaws are removed while the pet is undergoing spaying or neutering. No fuss no muss profitable breeding supplies and educationdon&#039;t forget, subscribe, like and make comment. At three days old, our standard poodle puppies have their dew claws removed and their tails docked.</p>
        <h3>So, If You Remove The Dew Claws, There Will Be Muscles In Your Dog’s Legs That Will Atrophy Due To Lack Of Use.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>However, removing dew claws can cause pain for your dog, and may be a costly surgery if your dog is beyond the puppy stage (and your breeder did not remove them). If you choose to have this procedure performed it should done when a puppy is under 5 days of age and only after the area has been numbed with a local anesthetic (e.g., emla cream). It’s so simple and fast.</p>
        <h3>Keep In Mind That Removing The Dewclaws In Other Breeds, Like Great Pyrenees, Disqualifies Them From The Show Ring.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>In many breeds — but certainly not all — the dewclaw has traditionally been removed in the first few days of a dog’s life. The dew claws actually work to prevent excessive torque on the leg. If the dew claws aren’t present, the leg can twist over and over, and ultimately the dog can become lame.</p>
