        <h3>As Long As You’ve Been Keeping Up With Potty Training And Crate Training, Then You’ll Most Likely Find That Your Puppy Is Sleeping Through The Night Fine At This Point.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>As with babies, puppies will often wake up pretty early. Many new pet parents will also try to crate train [8] their puppy during this time. Take care of yourself — it’ll be even easier to be the best you can be for your little bundle of furry joy.</p>
        <h3>It’s Much Better To Gradually Build Up Their Time Away From You So That They Feel Relaxed And Comfortable At Night Time.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Although the tips above are proven to work, some people unable to get their dogs to sleep through the night have reported success using music. Getting your puppy used to being alone at night Here are some tips for helping your puppy sleep:</p>
        <h3>But Your Puppy Isn’t Sleeping Through The Night And There Is A Simple Reason Why.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Puppies are a lot like human babies. If your puppy has mites, he will also not be able to sleep without waking up to scratch. If you ignore teaching your small fur to sleep at night, they may disturb your sleep barking and crying.</p>
        <h3>Setting The Scene Is An Effective Way To Make It Clear To Your Puppy That It’s Time To Go To Bed For The Night.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Physical activity will tire your pup out and they will sleep for longer stretches at a time. Their small and growing bodies tire very quickly. But mental energy can keep a puppy up just as easily as physical energy, so try a puzzle feeder for dinner or do some late night training to tire out their mind as well as their body.</p>
        <h3>Waking Up Early To Take Puppy For A Potty Break And Give Her Some Attention Is A Normal Part Of.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Puppies typically cannot hold their bladder for more than a few hours at a time. By the time a puppy is twelve weeks old, you can reasonably expect that they are capable of sleeping through the night. Gradually, your puppy will build bladder control and should be able to sleep through the night without needing to go to the bathroom as frequently.</p>
