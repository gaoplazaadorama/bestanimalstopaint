        <h3>The 17 Species Of British Bat All Hibernate During The.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>From geese and swans to redwings and fieldfares, there are plenty of birds to look out for. From deer to birds, and elsewhere bears and elk, many species are triggered by the. When they hibernate their heartbeat and breathing slow right down, and the body temperature drops to only a few degrees above freezing.</p>
        <h3>Swifts Arrive In Britain In Late April Or Early May, And Are A Welcome Sight And Sound In The Skies.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>More than 20 million may gather in a single cave. Some even cross the channel to reach southern europe. Many kinds of birds migrate south each autumn.</p>
        <h3>Winter Visitors Tend To Arrive Over A Longer Time Period And Are Not In Such A Rush As Spring Migrants;.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Visiting birds such as swallows gather to migrate abroad, while geese arrive from cold countries to overwinter here. The arctic tern covers a migrating cycle of over 40,000 miles and is thought to have the longest migration cycle of all animals. To celebrate the arrival of this beautiful season, take a look at our favourite autumn animals.</p>
        <h3>In The Fall, These Animals Get Ready For Winter By Eating Extra Food And Storing It As Body Fat.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>A truly epic migration covering 200 miles a day! Across the world animals of all kinds migrate, ranging from huge whales to tiny insects. That&#039;s why it&#039;s essential for this family of animals including snakes and turtles to hibernate during the colder months.</p>
        <h3>“At The End Of Every Summer, More Than 100 Million Individuals.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Frogs and newts will hibernate on the bottom of ponds, but if these ponds are full of leaf matter this can prove deadly to a hibernating amphibian if the pond freezes over. All preparations are triggered by the shorter daylight hours and cooler temperatures of autumn. This is why in the uk we see the departure of our breeding species such as swallows and sand martins at the end of our summer as they move out before our colder weather arrives, and we see the arrival of migrant geese and swan species in the autumn as they escape the harsher winter conditions of the arctic.</p>
