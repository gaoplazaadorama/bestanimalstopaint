        <h3>They Usually Begin To Walk With A Wobbly Gait Around 18 To 21 Days Of Age.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Newborn puppies make tiny squeaking noises when they are cold, but for the most part are fairly quiet. Most puppies will be able to rise up on their forelimbs around 5 to 6 days of age and will begin to use their hind legs around two weeks old. And most puppies are standing and taking their first wobbly steps by the end of the third week of life.</p>
        <h3>The Third Week Is All About Getting Puppies Up On Their Legs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>When considering how far to walk your puppy, the kennel club recommends using a ratio of five minutes of exercise per month of age twice a day. You won’t see your puppy being good at walking until he is between 4 weeks old and 5 weeks old. Although protocols vary, a puppy is usually fully vaccinated against a variety of serious diseases by 20 weeks.</p>
        <h3>Then, It Only Takes Them Between 21 To 28 Days Of Age To Start Walking With An Unsteady Gait.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Young puppies should be ready to walk and play when they reach around 6 or 7 weeks of age. At approximately 2 weeks old, puppies start trying to stand. Newborn puppies should begin walking when they are 4 weeks old.</p>
        <h3>Providing Your Young Dog With Proper Exercise Isn’t Very Difficult.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Puppy start standing (4) puppy will start playing with littermates at the age of 4 weeks At 2 weeks old they’ll be starting to stand, at 3 weeks, they’ll be ready to climb out of their whelping box. However, the walking itself will be shaky and unsteady.</p>
        <h3>Before A Puppy Can Walk Properly, It Needs To Learn How To Balance Itself.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>For the first two weeks of life, newborn puppies are unable to bear their weight, so they crawl around on their bellies, paddle and try to move their legs and build strength. Giving you a good guideline for when you can begin taking them on walks. Puppies have a lot to learn in their first 16 weeks of life.</p>
