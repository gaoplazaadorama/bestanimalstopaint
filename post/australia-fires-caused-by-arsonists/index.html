    <p>Australia’s arson crisis (updated) january 3, 2020. The green policies led inexorably to the primary cause behind all the fires: Since november, australia has arrested 183 people for starting the raging fires.</p>
        <h3>Are The Australian Wildfires Caused By Arsonists?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Arsonists have been responsible for some of australia’s worst fires, including a fire that killed 10 people on black saturday in 2009. Firefighters say lightning caused majority. Australian police investigating the bushfires have arrested more than 180 alleged arsonists since the start of 2019.</p>
        <h3>Only 24 People Were Charged For Deliberately Starting Bushfires, Which Is Fewer Than In Previous Years.bushfires In Australia Are Becoming More Common Due To Climate Change.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Which could certainly contribute, but is in no way proof of starting it. Dozens have been arrested in australia for arson as ferocious bushfires leave 26 dead and destroyed thousands of homes. A few of those arrests involved one man who warmed his tea with a fire, which was then put out by fighters.</p>
