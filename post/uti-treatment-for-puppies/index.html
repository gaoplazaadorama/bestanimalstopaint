        <h3>Antibiotics Are The Typical Treatment For Utis In Dogs, And The Vet May Also Prescribe Pain Medication, Because Utis Can Be Very Uncomfortable For Dogs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Echinacea can give your dog a soothing effect and help with inflammation caused by the uti. To clear the infection for chronic utis, treatment will address the underlying cause. Also, if your dog has a urinary tract infection with minimal bleeding, it can be pretty beneficial.</p>
        <h3>Treating Puppy Utis The Exact Course Of Treatment Will Depend On Your Puppy’s Specific Case, But Will Likely Involve Antibiotics To Eliminate The Bacteria Present In The Body.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Avoid giving your dog citrus juice with lots of sugar because it could make the uti much worse. You can give this remedy up to twice a day for seven to ten days depending on the severity of the infection. There are several studies supporting the use of cranberries in the management of dog utis.</p>
        <h3>Clean Your Dog’s Food Bowl Often To Keep It Clear Of Harmful Bacteria Or Mold.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Horsetail is antimicrobial, so it can help fight off infection. Step 6 feed your puppy canned food. Your vet may also recommend fluid therapy to help flush out the urinary tract and kidneys.</p>
        <h3>Horsetail Is Most Effective When Combined With A Calming Herb Such As Marshmallow Root.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Probiotics can be given to dogs either as a supplement or in food. If your vet prescribes antibiotics, make sure you give your dog all of the medication, even if they appear to be doing better, to be sure the infection is resolved and to help prevent reinfection. Repeat up to 2 times per day for up to 7 to 10 days, depending on how severe the uti is.</p>
        <h3>Typically, It Takes Uncomplicated Utis To Resolve In 3 To 5 Days, But Dr.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>While not a cure for utis, providing more water for your dog can lessen the chance of this infection from starting. There are several home remedies that you can use to help treat utis in dogs besides only antibiotics. However, it&#039;s important to continue antibiotic treatment until the full prescription has been used up.</p>
