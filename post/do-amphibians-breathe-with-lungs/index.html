        <h3>Amphibian Lungs Are Very Archaic Compared To Those Of Mammals And Birds.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Most females lay eggs in the water and the babies, called larvae or tadpoles, live in the water, using gills to breathe and finding food as fish do. The environment in which amphibians live. Oxygen from the air or water can pass through the moist skin of amphibians to enter the blood.</p>
        <h3>Because Their Skin Must Remain Moist In Order To Absorb Oxygen, They Release Mucous To Keep It Moist (If They Get Too Dry, They Cannot Breathe And Will Die).</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The lungs of amphibians are characterized by their simplicity. Apart from very few exceptions, mammals, amphibians and reptiles have to regularly return to the water surface to get some oxygen. These animals intake air through the nostril into their mouth which eventually flows down their throat, the muscles expand and contract for the gas exchange to take place in the lungs.</p>
        <h3>Amphibians / Amphibians Life / By Lynn G.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>At birth, they are aquatic animals, but as they grow they spend most of. The breathing and respiratory organs of amphibians include their lungs, skin, the buccal cavity lining, and of course their gills. Early in life, amphibians have gills for breathing.</p>
        <h3>Subsequently, Question Is, Do Amphibians Breathe Air Or Water?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>They are much better at this than us humans. As long as their skin is moist, they can absorb oxygen directly from the air or water through the skin. Adult amphibians either have lungs or continue to breathe through their skin.amphibians have three ways of breathing.</p>
        <h3>Under Water They Hold Their Breath.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Branchial, cutaneous, oropharyngeal and pulmonary. Tadpoles and certain aquatic amphibians breathe using gills similar to fish. Amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region.</p>
