    <p>A general guide for exercising puppies is to allow them one to two sessions of five minutes walking for each month of age, so for example, a four month old pup could enjoy walks of 20 minutes at a time, once or twice a day. 15 minutes when 3 months old 20 minutes when 4 months old and so on.
